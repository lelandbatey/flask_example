## Getting Familiar with Flask

Each "flask#.py" file will have some simple code that's directly runable.

## BUT WAIT - You have to set it up first

Just as in pretty much anything in Python, "setting up" something is just a matter of installing it. That can be done just by using a `sudo apt-get install python-flask`.

**However**, there is a better way to do this! Read [here for more info about `virtualenv`](https://github.com/lelandbatey/flask_example/blob/master/info/virtualenv.md).
